## Development Environment for Data Science

- Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language.
- It has a very large community that is very helpful as you learn.
- It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. 
- Pythonâ€™s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.

### Python 2.7 vs 3.6

The differences are much smaller than it may seem. Key differences are highlighted [here](http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_python_2_3_key_diff.html). 

At General Assembly, we use 2.7.

### Key Tools

We need several things to productively work with Python for Data Science. These include:
 
- install the [Anaconda](https://docs.continuum.io/) distribution and know how to install packages
- navigate the basic command line => let's do it!
- edit code in a text editor like [sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/), an IDE like [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), or [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/index.html) notebooks
- collaborate via Git & [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- leverage [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)

later:
- compete on [Kaggle](http://kaggle.com/)
- build [Deep Neural Networks](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- run code on [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)
- use big data technologies like [Apache Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/) and [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/)
