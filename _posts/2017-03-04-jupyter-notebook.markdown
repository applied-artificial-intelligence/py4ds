## The Jupyter Notebook

We use Jupyter (for Julia, Python, and R) Notebooks for our in-class exercises and homework because they allow to combine text - explanation & documentation - with code and visualizations.

Jupyter notebooks are powered by a server application that interprets the code and represents the results together with all other notebooks elements in a browser. This makes it ideal for interactive analysis. 
 
Let's start the Jupyter server by running the following command in a working directory of your choice:

```py
jupyter notebook
```
