## What are Numpy and Pandas?  

Python packages for matrix algebra and general data manipulation.

Pandas is built on Numpy.

Numpy uses arrays (lists) to do basic math and slice and index data.

Pandas uses a data structure called a DataFrame.

Dataframes are similar to Excel tables; they contain rows and columns.
