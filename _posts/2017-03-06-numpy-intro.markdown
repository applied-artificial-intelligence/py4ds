## What are Numpy and Pandas?  

[Numpy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/reference/) is a very powerful python package for matrix algebra and general data manipulation.

Pandas uses data structures called Series and DataFrame.

Dataframes are similar to Excel tables; they contain rows and columns.
